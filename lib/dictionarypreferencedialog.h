/**
 * @short This abstract base class specifies the interface for dictionary
 * preference dialogs in user applications. The DictionaryManager class can be
 * asked for a list of these objects for the current session, and the appropriate
 * signal/slot connections can be made to handle dictionary preferences transparently
 * to the user application.
 *
 * One annoying caveat is that the user application still has to add preference elements
 * to it's own kcfg file, or the preference code will crash when trying to work with it.
 * Sadly, at the moment the only way to figure out what needs to be added to the kcfg is
 * to read the code, or the kiten.kcfg implementation.
