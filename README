Make sure you visit the preferences page. It outlines the necessary dictionaries you will have to install / tell Kiten about.

To tell Kiten about your dictionaries, visit the "edict" and "kanjidic" configuration pages, under the "Dictionaries" configuration page, and use the "Add" button. Then type in the full path to your dictionary files, and whatever name you want in the first column.

Hope Kiten is useful to you!
