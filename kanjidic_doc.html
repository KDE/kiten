<b><a name="IREF01">INTRODUCTION</a></b>
</P>
<P>
The KANJIDIC file contains comprehensive information about Japanese kanji. It
is a text file currently 6,355 lines long, with one line for each kanji in
the two levels of the characters specified in the JIS X 0208-1990 set. (For
information about this set, see Appendix A.)
</P>
<P>
The file contains a mixture of ASCII characters and kana/kanji encoded using
the EUC (Extended Unix Code) coding.
</P>
<P>
Attention is drawn to the KANJIDIC LICENCE  STATEMENT  AND  COPYRIGHT  NOTICE
included below in this document.
</P>
<P>
A similar file, KANJD212, is available for the 5,801 supplementary kanji in
the JIS X 0212-1990 set.
</P>
<P>
<b><a name="IREF02">CONTENTS &amp; FORMAT</a></b>
</P>
<P>
The first part of each line is of a fixed format,  indicating which character
the line is for, while the rest is more free-format.
</P>
<P>
The first two bytes are the kanji itself.  There is then a space,  the 4-byte
ASCII representation of the hexadecimal coding of the two-byte JIS  encoding,
and another space.
</P>
<P>
The  rest  of  the line is composed of a combination of three kinds of fields
(which may be in any order and interspersed):
</P>
<OL type="a">
<LI>information fields,  beginning with an identifying letter and ending with
a  space. See below for more information about these fields.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>readings (with '-' to indicate prefixes/suffixes,  and '.' to separate  a
reading  from  its  okurigana).  ON-yomi  are in katakana and KUN-yomi are in
hiragana. There may be several classes of reading fields, with ordinary
readings first, followed by members of the other classes, if any. The current
other classes, and their tagging, are:
<OL type="i">
<LI>where the kanji has special "nanori" (i.e.  name) readings,
these are preceded the marker "T1";
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>where the kanji is a radical, and the radical name is not already
a reading, the radical name is preceded the marker "T2".
<P>
(Other Tn classes may be created at a later date.)
</P>
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>English meanings.  Each such field begins with an open brace '{' and ends
at the next close brace '}'.
</LI>
</OL>
<b><a name="IREF03">INFORMATION FIELDS</a></b>
<P>
There are currently a variety of predefined fields (programs  using  KANJIDIC
should not make any assumptions about the presence or absence of any of these
fields, as KANJIDIC is certain to be extended in the future):
</P>
<DL><DD>
B&lt;num&gt; -- the radical (Bushu) number.  There is  one  per  entry.  As
far  as  possible,  this is the radical number used in the Nelson 
"Modern
Japanese-English Character Dictionary" (i.e. the Classic, not the New Nelson).  Where  the classical or
historical radical number differs from this,  it  is  present as a
separate C&lt;num&gt; entry.
<P>
C&lt;num&gt;  --  the  historical  or  classical radical number, as recorded
in the KangXi Zidian (where this differs from the B&lt;num&gt; entry.) There
will be at most one of these.
</P>
<P>
F&lt;num&gt; -- the frequency-of-use ranking.  At most one  per  line.  The
2,135 most-used characters have a ranking; those characters that lack
this field are not ranked.  The frequency is a number from 1 to 2,135
that expresses the relative frequency of occurrence of a character in
modern  Japanese.  The  data  is based on statistics published by The
National Language Research Institute (Tokyo), interpreted and adapted
by Jack Halpern in a manner to make it useful  to  the  learner.  The
data  is  derived  from the New Japanese-English Character Dictionary
(Kenkyusha,   Tokyo  1990;   NTC,   Chicago  1993).   The  commercial
utilization  of  the  frequency numbers is prohibited without written
permission from Jack Halpern.  Use by individuals  and  small  groups
for  reference and research purposes is permitted,  on condition that
acknowledgment of the source and this notice are included.
</P>
<P>
G&lt;num&gt; -- the Jouyou grade level.  At most one per line.  G1  through
G6  indicate Jouyou grades 1-6.  G8 indicates general-use characters.
G9 indicates Jinmeiyou  ("for  use  in  names")  characters.  If  not
present, it is a kanji outside these categories.
</P>
<P>
H&lt;num&gt;  --  the  index  number  in the New Japanese-English Character
Dictionary,  edited by Jack Halpern.  At most one allowed  per  line.
If not preset, the character is not in Halpern.
</P>
<P>
N&lt;num&gt;  --  the  index number in the "Modern Reader's Japanese-English
Character Dictionary",  edited by Andrew Nelson.  At most one  allowed
per  line.  If  not  present,  the character is not in Nelson,  or is
considered to be a non-standard version,  in which case it may have a
cross-reference  code  in  the  form:  XNnnnn.  (Note that many kanji
currently used are what Nelson described as "non-standard"  forms  or
glyphs.)
</P>
<P>
V&lt;num&gt; -- the index number in The New Nelson Japanese-English
Character Dictionary, edited by John Haig.
</P>
<P>
D&lt;code&gt; -- the "D" codes will be progressively used for dictionary
based codes.
</P>
<P>
(a) DRnnnn - these are the codes developed by Father Joseph De Roo,
and published in his book "2001 Kanji" (Bojinsha). Fr De Roo has
given his permission for these codes to be included.
</P>
<P>
(b) DKnnnn - the index numbers used by Jack Halpern in his Kanji
Learners Dictionary, published by Kodansha in 1999. The numbers have
been provided by Mr Halpern.
</P>
<P>
(c) DOnnnn - the index numbers used in P.G. O'Neill's Essential Kanji
(ISBN 0-8348-0222-8). The numbers have been provided by Glenn Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
P&lt;code&gt;  --  the  SKIP  pattern  code.  The  &lt;code&gt;  is  of  the form
"P&lt;num&gt;-&lt;num&gt;-&lt;num&gt;".  The  System  of  Kanji  Indexing  by  Patterns
(SKIP)  is  a  scheme  for  the classification and rapid retrieval of
Chinese characters on the basis of  geometrical  patterns.  Developed
by  Jack  Halpern,  it  first  appeared  in  the New Japanese-English
Character Dictionary (Kenkyusha, Tokyo 1990;  NTC, Chicago 1993), and
is  being  used in a series of dictionaries and learning tools called
KIT  (Kanji  Integrated  Tools).  SKIP  is  protected  by  copyright,
copyleft  and patent laws.  The commercial utilization of SKIP in any
form is strictly forbidden without the  written  permission  of  Jack
Halpern,  the  copyright  holder  (jhalpern@cc.win.or.jp).  (A  brief
summary of the method is in Appendix C. See Appendix E. for some of
the rules applied when counting strokes in some of the radicals.)
</P>
<P>
S&lt;num&gt; -- the stroke count.  At least one  per  line.  If  more  than
one,  the  first  is considered the accepted count,  while subsequent
ones are common miscounts. (See Appendix E. For some of the rules
applied when counting strokes in some of the radicals.)
</P>
<P>
U&lt;hexnum&gt;  --  the Unicode encoding of the kanji.  See Appendix B for
further information on this code. There is exactly one per line.
</P>
<P>
I&lt;code&gt; -- the index codes in the reference books by Spahn  &amp;
Hadamitzky. These codes take two forms:
</P>
<P>
(a) for The Kanji Dictionary (Tuttle 1996), they are in the form
nxnn.n,  e.g.  3k11.2, where the kanji has 3
strokes in the identifying radical, it is radical "k" in the S&amp;H
classification system, there are 11 other strokes, and it is the 2nd
kanji in the 3k11 sequence. I am very grateful to Mark Spahn for
providing the (almost) full list of these descriptor codes for the
kanji in this file. At the time of writing some 800 kanji in the
file lack the SH descriptor. This is because the book used a
different glyph as the primary kanji. The gaps are gradually being
filled in. Where the JIS X 0208 glyph is the second kanji for a
particular descriptor code, it has a "-2" appended to the code.
</P>
<P>
(b) for the Kanji &amp; Kana book (Tuttle), they are in the form
INnnnn, where nnnn is the number of the 1,945 kanji referenced in
that book.
</P>
<P>
Qnnnn.n -- the "Four Corner" code for that  kanji.  This  is  a  code
invented by Wang Chen in 1928, it has since then been widely used for
dictionaries in China and Japan. In some cases there are two of these
codes, as it is can be little ambiguous, and Morohashi has some kanji
coded differently from their traditional Chinese codes.  See Appendix
D  for  an overview of the Four Corner System.  Christian Wittern,
who passed on these codes, comments that they are in need of
proof-reading and  thus  users  are  advised to be cautious using the
codes for serious scholarship.
</P>
<P>
MNnnnnnnn  and  MPnn.nnnn  --  the  index  number   and   volume.page
respectively of the kanji in  the 13-volume Morohashi Daikanwajiten.
In the MNnnn field, a terminal `P`, e.g. MN4879P, indicates  that it
is 4879' in the original. In some 500 cases, the number is terminated
with an `X`, to indicate that the kanji in Morohashi has a close, but
not identical, glyph to the form in the JIS X 0208 standard.
</P>
<P>
Ennnn  --  the  index number used in "A Guide To Remembering Japanese
Characters" by Kenneth G.  Henshall.  There are 1945 kanji with these
numbers (i.e. the Jouyou subset.)
</P>
<P>
Knnnn -- the index number in the  Gakken  Kanji  Dictionary  ("A  New
Dictionary  of Kanji Usage").  Some of the numbers relate to the list
at  the  back  of  the  book,  jouyou  kanji  not  contained  in  the
dictionary, and various historical tables at the end.
</P>
<P>
Lnnnn -- the index number used in "Remembering The  Kanji"  by  James
Heisig.
</P>
<P>
Onnnn -- the index number in "Japanese Names", by P.G. O'Neill.
(Weatherhill, 1972) (A warning: some of the numbers end with 'A'. This
is how they appear in the book; it is not a problem with the file.)
</P>
<P>
Wxxxx -- the romanized form of the Korean reading(s) of the kanji.
Most of these kanji have one Korean reading, a few have two or more.
The readings are in the (Republic of Korea) Ministry of Education
style of romanization.
</P>
<P>
Yxxxxx -- the "Pinyin" of each kanji, i.e.  the (Mandarin or Beijing)
Chinese romanization.  About 6,000 of the kanji have these. Obviously
most of the native Japanese kokuji do not have Pinyin, however at least
one does as it was taken into Chinese at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Xxxxxxx -- a cross-reference code. An entry of, say, XN1234 will mean
that the user is referred to the kanji with the (unique) Nelson index
of  1234.  XJ0xxxx and XJ1xxxx are cross-references to the kanji with
the JIS hexadecimal code of xxxx. The `0' means the reference is to a
JIS X 0208 kanji, and the `1' references a JIS X 0212 kanji.
</P>
<P>
Zxxxxxx -- a mis-classification code.  It means that  this  kanji  is
sometimes mis-classified as having the xxxxxx coding.  In the case of
the SKIP classifications,  an extra letter code is used  to  indicate
the  type  of  mis-classification.  ZPPn-n-n,  ZSPn-n-n  and ZBPn-n-n
indicate mis-classification according to position,  stroke-count  and
both position and stroke-count. (ZRPn-n-n codes are where Jim
Breen &amp;
Jack Halpern are having a [hopefully temporary] disagreement over the
number of strokes.)
</DL>
If the final field of a line is not an English field, there is a final space.
Each reading and information field is therefore bracketed by space characters
(which makes it convenient for searches using programs like "grep".)
</P>
<P>
As  far  as  possible  all  entries  will  have  their  yomikata and readings
attached, even if they are a recognized variant of another kanji.  This is to
facilitate electronic searches using these fields as keys,  and should not be
taken as a recommendation to use such obscure kanji.
</P>
<P>
<b><a name="IREF04">CURRENT USAGE</a></b>
</P>
<P>
KANJIDIC  is used now to build the "kinfo.dat" file which is used by JDIC and
JREADER,  and by Stephen Chung's  JWP.  "kinfo.dat"  contains  the  identical
information,  but  in  a compressed form and in a structure suitable for fast
indexed access.
</P>
<P>
KANJIDIC  is  also  used in the XJDIC and MacJDic dictionary programs,  and a
growing number of other programs such as KDRILL and KDIC.

If  you  have  suggested  changes,  send  diffs  [not  complete  files]  with
corrections to him.
<P>
<b><a name="IREF06">TOO MUCH INFORMATION?</a></b>
</P>
<P>
KANJIDIC is now rather large, and has information in it which is not much use
for  people who are not studying and researching Japanese orthography.  It is
still appropriate to maintain it as a useful freely-available  compendium  of
such information.
</P>
<P>
For people who only wish to use a subset  of  the  information  in  KANJIDIC,
there is a program "kdfilt.c", also available as kdfilt.exe for MS-DOS, which
will strip out unwanted fields. Dan Crevier has also released a program
(kanjidicSplit) which does the same for MacJDic users. (For users of the JDIC
program, the KANJDFIX.EXE utility also strips out unwanted fields prior to
building the KINFO.DAT file.)
</P>
<P>
<b><a name="IREF07">HISTORY</a></b>
</P>
<P>
(some comments by Jim Breen)
</P>
<P>
KANJIDIC began as two files:  jis1detl.lst and jis2detl.lst, which were later
merged into a single file.
</P>
<P>
The  first  file was compiled initially from the file "kinfo.dat" supplied by
Stephen Chung,  who in turn compiled his file from a file  prepared  by  Mike
Erickson.  I  originally added about 1900 "meanings" by James Heisig keyed in
by Kevin Moore from the book "Remembering  The  Kanji".  I  later  added  the
meanings  from  Rik Smoody's files,  compiled when he was working for Sony in
Japan. These appear to have been based on Nelson.
</P>
<P>
The second file was compiled from a complete JIS2 list with Bushu and  stroke
counts  kindly  supplied  to  me  by  Jon  Crossley,  to which I added Nelson
numbers, yomikata and meanings extracted from Rik Smoody's file.
</P>
<P>
Theresa Martin was an  early  assister  with  this  file,  particularly  with
tracking  down  and  correcting many mistranscribed yomikata (the old zu/dzu,
oo/ou, ji/dji, etc. problems).
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Friedl did a major overhaul in September-October 1992,  in  which  he
added  the  frequency  rankings,  Halpern codes,  SKIP patterns,  updated the
grading ("G" fields) to reflect the modern Jouyou  lists,  corrected  radical
numbers,  corrected  stroke  counts  and readings to fall in line with modern
usage.
</P>
<P>
Magnus Halldorsson corrected some erroneous  Halpern  numbers,  and  provided
them  for  a  lot  of  the radicals.  He provided the list of Heisig indices,
which he originally compiled himself,  then verified and expanded using lists
from Richard Walters and Antti Karttunen. He also passed on to me the list of
Gakken indices compiled by Antti Karttunen.
</P>
<P>
Lee Collins provided the Unicode mappings (see appendix B)
</P>
<P>
Iain Sinclair has provided the yomikata,  meanings and S&amp;H indices of many of
the obscure JIS2 kanji.
</P>
<P>
Christian  Wittern,  a  Sinologist  working  at Kyoto University,  sent me a
monster file prepared by Dr Urs App from Hanazono College.  From this I  have
extracted the Four Corner and Morohashi information.  Christian also provided
the  original Pinyin details, which were later replaced. I am very grateful
for these significant contributions.
</P>
<P>
In March  1994  the  Morohashi  indices  were  proof-read  and  corrected  by
Christian.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Pinochet supplied all the Henshall numbers.
</P>
<P>
Ingar Holst has provided considerable assistance in regularizing the Bnnn and
Cnnn  radical classifications to remove some errors that were in the original
JIS2 file, and to make it all conform to Nelson's classification.
</P>
<P>
In mid-1993 I withdrew the  SKIP  codes  from  the  distributed  file  as  it
appeared  that  their  presence  violated  Jack  Halpern's copyright on these
codes. Jeffrey Friedl contacted Jack about this, and Jack obtained permission
from his publisher for the codes to be included subject to the copyright  and
usage restrictions stated in this document. In March 1994 the Halpern indices
and SKIP codes were checked against an extract from Jack's files, and the "Z"
mis-classification  codes added,  again from his files.  Jack has also made a
lot of useful comments and suggestions about the content and  format  of  the
file.  I am most grateful to Jack for his permission and assistance, and also
to Jeffrey for making the contact.
</P>
<P>
In May 1995, a number of updates took place. Jeffrey Friedl established
contact with James Heisig, and obtained a further set of his indices. I
contacted Mark Spahn (via the "honyaku" mailing list) and he kindly provided
most of the missing S&amp;H descriptors, and Jack Halpern released to me the SKIP
codes of the kanji not in the New Japanese-English Character Dictionary. For
all this material I am most grateful.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, I added the O'Neill index numbers. These were compiled by
Jenny Nazak, David Rosenfeld and myself. Thanks to Jenny &amp; David for their
assistance.
</P>
<P>
In January and February 1996 the Morohashi numbers were checked thoroughly
against two important sources: a file of Unicode-Morohashi data (Uni2Dict)
which was prepared by Koichi Yasuoka from the allocation in the JIS X 0221
standard, and the review draft of the proposed revision of the JIS X 0208
standard, which was prepared by the INSTAC Committee, and made available in
a text file, thus enabling comparisons. All the mismatches between the three
files were examined against the Morohashi text, and extensive corrections
made to all three files. I am grateful to Koichi Yasuoka and Masayuki
Toyoshima for their considerable assistance in this task.
</P>
<P>
In March 1996 the Korean readings were added. They were provided by Dr
Charles Muller of Toyo Gakuen University (acmuller@gol.com), to whom I
am most grateful. Chuck's compilation of Korean readings is extremely
thorough and scholarly, and I am pleased to be able to incorporate
them.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996 the readings of all the kanji were compared with those in the
JIS X 0208 draft, and a number of corrections and additions made.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996 I carried out a "unification" of the readings of the KANJIDIC
and KANJD212 files, wherein all the readings of the "itaiji" were brought
into line. The identification of these itaiji was drawn from a file posted
to the fj.kanji group by Taichi Kawabata (kawabata@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp),
which was compiled at the ETL  from the  itaiji identification in the
JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212 standards. I corrected a few errors, and added
some extra sets which were indicated in the JIS X 0208-1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996 the Pinyin details were completely replaced by a new set. The
original Pinyin were from an earlier compilation by Christian Wittern, and
and contained many errors. Two more reliable sources had become available:
the Uni2Pinyin file compiled by Koichi Yasuoka, which is based in part on
the TONEPY.tit by Yongguang Zhang; and the PYCHAR set of readings of Big5
hanzi compiled by Christian Wittern. The Pinyin currently in the KANJIDIC
file is a combination of the two, following the order in the Uni2Pinyin
file.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996 I corrected a few more missing and erroneous Nelson numbers,
using a massive Nelson list prepared by Wolfgang Cronrath. He also flagged
the kokuji, so I added these to the readings fields as "{(kokuji)}".
</P>
<P>
Also in August 1996 I deleted the handful of former "XJxxxx" cross-references,
and replaced them with a much more comprehensive set, so that they now
represent all the recognized "itaiji". The file I used for this was the
corrected itaiji file mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997 I corrected a large number of bushu codes. Many of these had
been identified as errors by Jean-Luc Leger (reiga@iria.mines.u-nancy.fr) who
analyzed and examined all the Nelson bushu. I also identified and added a large
number of missing Cnnn codes.
</P>
<P>
Also in April 1997 I added the S&amp;H "Kanji &amp; Kana" indices. These had been
keyed by Olivier Galibert (Olivier.Galibert@mines.u-nancy.fr). (There must
be an outbreak of kanji interest on Nancy.)
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, the long-awaited inclusion of the "New Nelson" numbers took
place. I had been waiting for the editor of the New Nelson, John Haig, to
supply a list (as he had agreed some years before), but in the meantime,
Jean-Luc Leger keyed a list, so they are now available.
</P>
<P>
Also between December 1997 and February 1998 a large number of Level 2
kanji had their stroke counts corrected to bring them into line with the
counting principles used in the Level 1 kanji. This usually aligned the
counts with those used in the New Nelson and in S&amp;H. Appendix E of this
document was amended to reflect this. The leg-work in tracking this material
down was done by Wolfgang Cronrath.
</P>
<P>
During December 1998 &amp; Jan 1999 I updated the stroke counts of many of the
Level 2 kanji, using an analysis of them carried out by Wolfgang Cronrath.
I also added the De Roo codes, which had been keyed by Jasmin Blanchette,
who also typed the explanatory material. I contacted Fr De Roo in Tokyo who
readily agreed to the inclusion of thecodes.

For full information about JIS codes,  please  see  Ken  Lunde's  "japan.inf"

1993. The following is a brief extract from the "japan.inf" file.
</P>
<P>
"The  Japanese  character  set  as  described in the document JIS X 0208-1990
specifies 6,879 standard characters; 6,355 kanji in 2 levels (Level 1:  2,965
kanji arranged by pronunciation;  Level 2:  3,390 kanji arranged by radical),
86 katakana, 83 hiragana, 10 numerals, 52 Roman characters,  147 symbols,  66
Russian  characters,  48  Greek characters,  and 32 line elements (for making
charts).
</P>
<P>
This standard was first established in 1978,  modified for the first time  in
1983 (character position swapping,  glyph changes, and four kanji appended to
JIS Level 2),  and modified again in 1990 (two kanji  were  appended  to  JIS
Level 2). This character set is widely implemented on a variety of platforms.
Encoding methods for JIS X 0208-1990 include Shift-JIS, EUC, and JIS."

<b><a name="IREF10">APPENDIX B - UNICODE</a></b>
</P>
<P>
The  following  information  about  Unicode  was  provided in 1992 by Lee
Collins at  Taligent.
</P>
<P>
(The Unicode sequences are) "the  final,  official  mapping  to  JIS  of  the
CJK-JRG's  (Chinese,   Japanese,   Korean-  Joint  Research  Group)  "Unified
Repertoire and Ordering Version 2.0" which is the unified Han  character  set
of  ISO  10646  and  Unicode.  All  of  the  Unicode  companies (Apple,  IBM,
Microsoft, NeXT,  Taligent,  etc) are now using this mapping.  There has been
some confusion because of difference in nomenclature.  Unicode people call it
UniHan,  the  Chinese sometimes call it HCS (Han Character Set) and ISO calls
it "Ideographic CJK Character Unified Repertoire and Ordering". ISO can't use
the term "Han" character because Japan  was  very  sensitive  to  this  (even
though  it  is  a  direct  translation  of  "Kanzi") and it can't be called a
character set because only ISO WG2 is empowered with the authority to  encode
characters. Problems of naming aside, they are all the same thing.
</P>
<P>
The  CJK-JRG  was  formed  under  the aegis of ISO in 1990 to investigate and
propose a unified Han character set for inclusion in ISO  10646.  It  brought
together  various  experts  on Han characters from China,  Hong Kong,  Japan,
Korea,  Taiwan  and  the  United  States  selected  by  the  national  bodies
participating in ISO WG2.
</P>
<P>
Including  the  initial  work  in the US on Unicode and in China on GB 13000,
which were merged and became the basis for the URO,  the task spanned about 4
years.  The work was completed in April of this year.  It contains 21,000 Han
characters from all of the major standards used in East Asia, including JIS X
0208-1990  and  JIS  X  0212-1990.   The  Unicode   consortium   provides   a
cross-reference file for all of the source sets. To get a copy contact

now. For a slightly different presentation of the characters, a copy of 10646
or  of  the "Ideographic CJK Character Unified Repertoire and Ordering Version
2.0" might be available through the the Australian national body to ISO WG2."

Determine to which of the four PATTERNS your character belongs to get the
first part of the SKIP number (the PATTERN NUMBER).
</P>
<P>
If your character belongs to pattern #1, #2 or #3 (Áê¢ª#1), carry out the
steps in the left column; if it belongs to pattern #4 (²¼¢ª#4), carry out the
steps in the right column. (REF: R4. How to Identify the Pattern)

After determining the SKIP number of your character, locate your character
entry in one of two ways:
</P>
<P>
1. Determine the entry number in the Pattern Index beginning on p. 1952 then
locate your character entry in the main part of the dictionary.  See R3.1.2
Index Method for details.

<b><a name="IREF12">APPENDIX D: - AN OVERVIEW OF THE FOUR CORNER CODING SYSTEM</a></b>
</P>
<P>
The Four Corner System has been used for many years in China  and  Japan  for
classifying  kanji.  In  China  it  is  losing popularity in favour of Pinyin
ordering.  Some Japanese dictionaries,  such as the  Morohashi  Daikanwajiten
have a Four Corner Index.
</P>
<P>
The following overview of the system has been condensed from the article "The
Four Corner System:  an introduction with exercises" by  Dr  Urs  App,  which
appeared in the Electronic Bodhidharma No 2,  February 1992, published by the
International Research Institute for Zen Buddhism,  Hanazono  College.  (More
examples will be added from that article in due course.)
</P>
<PRE>
1. Stroke shapes are divided into ten classes:
<P>
.               0       LID               Ðµ
.               1       HORIZONTAL LINE   °ì
.               2       VERTICAL LINE     ¡Ã
.               3       DOT               Ð¦
.               4       CROSS             ½½
.               5       SKEWER            ¥­
.               6       BOX               ¸ý
.               7       ANGLE             ÒÌ
.               8       HACHI             È¬
.               9       CHIISAI           ¾®
</P>
<P>
2. The Four Digits are derived from the Four Corners in a Z-shaped order.
</P>
<P>
.               A    B                   7  1     7  7
.                        for example:     ¸¶       ·î
.               C    D                   2  9     2  2
</P>
<P>
Some examples: »Å 2421  ¹Ô 2122  Îò 7121  µû 2733  »ì 0762  Æ± 7722  ¶¶ 4292
</P>
<P>
3.  A shape is only used once.  If it fills several corners, it is counted as
zero in subsequent corners.
</P>
<P>
Some examples: ¸ý 6000  ¼ó 8060  Ê¬ 8022  Âç 2003  ÏÂ 2690  ÉÊ 6066  µþ 0096
</P>
<P>
4.  When the upper or lower half of a character consists of only one  (single
or composite) shape,  it is,  regardless of its position,  counted as a left
corner. The right corner is counted as zero.
</P>
<P>
Some examples: Î© 0010  Í³ 5060  Àã 1017  Êý 0022  Äí 0024  »å 2090  ¼ê 2050
</P>
<P>
5.  When there is no additional element to the four sides of  the  characters
.¸ý,  Ìç,  ò¨ (and sometimes ¹Ô), whatever is inside these characters is taken
for the lower two corners.
</P>
<P>
Some examples: Ìä 7760  ¼ü 6080  Ô¢ 6015  ÌÜ 6010  ³« 7744  ÌÌ 1060  îò 2110
</P>
<P>
6.  The analysis is based on the block-style handwritten kaisho (Ü´½ñ)  shape
of characters.
</P>
<P>
(This needs attention, as ¸Í is 3027, not 1027.  The top stroke is treated as
a Ð¦.)
</P>
<P>
7. Some points to note when analyzing shapes:
</P>
<P>
o Shape 0:
</P>
<P>
When the horizontal line below a DOT shape (number 3) is connected to another
stroke at its right-hand end (as in Õß ¸Í,  etc.) it is not counted as a  LID
(number 0) but as a DOT.
</P>
<P>
Examples: °Â 3040  ¿À 3520  µ§ 3222
</P>
<P>
o Shape 6:
</P>
<P>
Characters  such  as »® and Õù where one of the strokes of the square extends
beyond it,  are not considered to be square (number 6)  shapes,  but  corners
(number 7).
</P>
<P>
Examples: ³î 7710  ½ê 3222  »® 7710  ´Û 8377 µ¹ 3010
</P>
<P>
o Shape 7:
</P>
<P>
Only the cornered end of corner shapes (number 7) is counted as 7.
</P>
<P>
Examples: ¶è 7171  ¶Ô 7222 ¶ç 2762  È¿ 7124
</P>
<P>
o Shape 8:
</P>
<P>
Strokes that cross other strokes are not counted as shape number 8 (È¬).
</P>
<P>
Examples: Èþ 8043  ´Ø 7743  Âç 4003  ¼º 8043  ¹Õ 2143  Àí 9043
</P>
<P>
o Shape 9:
</P>
<P>
Shapes resembling shape 9, but featuring two strokes in the middle (as in the
top part of ¶È or ÁÑ) or two strokes on one side (as in ¿å or the bottom part
of Êé) are not considered as 9 shapes.
</P>
<P>
Examples: Êé 4433  ¶È 3290  ÁÑ 3214
</P>
<P>
8. Some points to note when choosing corners.
</P>
<P>
- when a corner is occupied by more than one independent or parallel strokes,
the one that extend furthest to the left or right is  taken  as  the  corner,
regardless of how high or low it is.
</P>
<P>
examples: Èó 1111  Ðë 2124  ¼À 0013  Äë 0022  ¼Ò 3421  ÌÔ 4721
</P>
<P>
- if there is another shape above (or, at the bottom of the character, below)
the  leftmost  or  rightmost  stroke  of  a  character,  that  shape is given
preference and is taken as the corner.
</P>
<P>
examples: »¡ 3090  ¹¬ 4040  á¶ 6020  ½÷ 4040  ã¹ 3521  Â¶ 4480
</P>
<P>
- when two composite stroke shapes are interwoven and each could be  regarded
as a corner,  the shape that is higher is taken as the upper corner,  and the
lower stroke as lower corner.
</P>
<P>
- when a stroke that slopes downwards to the left or right  is  supported  by
another stroke, the latter is taken as the corner.
</P>
<P>
examples: ±° 2740  Î¢ 0073  ¾Ë 1962  é° 4464  ·Ô 4410  Èï 3424
</P>
<P>
- a left slanting stroke on the upper left is taken for the left corner only;
for the right corner one takes a stroke more to the right.
</P>
<P>
examples: ¿È 2740  Ì¶ 2350  ³û 6752  Åª 2762  ½Ü 2762  Åç 2772
</P>
<P>
9. Shape variations: (Dr App includes several pages of examples)
</P>
<P>
10. The fifth corner:
</P>
<P>
In  order to differentiate between the several characters with the same code,
an optional "fifth corner" is sometimes used. This is, loosely, a shape above
the fourth corner which has not been used in any other shape.

this file does not strictly follow any reference, but tends to more
aligned to Halpern.
</P>
<OL>
<LI> B140 KUSA-KANMURI e.g. ²× always counted as 3 strokes (Halpern counts
this 4 strokes for the (mostly level 2) kanji where the older form is
often printed.) Note that this has been carried through to kanji where
this element is not the indexing radical, such as Û¯.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B162 SHIN-NYUU e.g. ô£ or °© counted as 3 or 4 strokes. (Nelson and
S&amp;H
count it as 2 strokes, and Halpern as either 3 or 4.) [See Note 1 below.]
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B163 OOZATOZUKIRI &amp; B170 KOZATO-HEN Ë® and ïô always counted as 3 strokes
(Nelson and S&amp;H count it as 2, Halpern as 3.) This also applies where it
appears mid-kanji, such as in Üó.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B199 MUGI Çþ always counted as 7 strokes, except for óÎ &amp; óÏ where it
is counted as 11. (Nelson and Halpern do the same, and S&amp;H avoid treating
it as a radical, but count it as 12 in the remainder.)
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B113 SHIMESU e.g. Îé, is counted as 4 strokes in that form, and 5 strokes
in its older form, ã«. 18 kanji are in the 4-stroke form and 20 are in
the 5-stroke form. (Nelson and S&amp;H count it as 4; Halpern counts it as 4
or 5. [See Note 1.])
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B184 SHOKU HEN ¿©, µ², etc.is counted as 8 strokes in the µ² form, and as
9 strokes in the Ò¬ and »Á forms. (Nelson and S&amp;H count it as 8 strokes,
and Halpern as 8 or 9.) [See Note 1. below.]
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B131 SHIN/KERAI ¿Ã. Counted as 7 (Nelson counts it as 6, Halpern as 7
(in the book), and S&amp;H as both for different kanji.)
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B136 MAI ASHI Á¤. Counted as 7 (traditionally counted as 6, in
accordance with the older writing of `¥ð'. Nelson counts as 6, S&amp;H as
7, and Halpern as 7 for ¾ïÍÑ and ¿ÍÌ¾ÍÑ´Á»ú and 6 for the rest.) Note
this is also applied to counting å¬ and for kanji with the ðê pattern.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> B131 SHIN or KERAI ¿Ã. Counted as 7 (traditionally counted as 6). Nelson
counts as 6, Halpern as 7, and S&amp;H as 6 or 7 in different cases.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> The ROO or OI radical (Ï·) has a variant consisting of the top 4 strokes.
For example, it is in ¼Ô. Traditionally, this variant had an extra dot,
and was counted as 5 strokes. I'm counting it as 4 throughout.
</LI>
</OL>
OTHER STROKE PATTERNS
<OL>
<LI> While the pattern ±± is a 6-stroke radical, the top half of Ò× is made up
of three distinct parts totalling 8 strokes. Note that this also is the
case with Õ¿, Þì, çÛ and Áé despite the simplification in the JIS glyphs.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> ²ç (KIBA HEN) is a problem. It is classically counted as 4 strokes, but
these days has a flick that makes it effectively 5. Halpern, Nelson and
S&amp;H usually have it as 5 strokes, so I'm standardizing on that.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> Another little horror is ÚÜ (MU or NASHI), which is classically counted
as 4 strokes. The most common variant has 5 strokes, but looks like 6.
Halpern, S&amp;H and the Classical Nelson count this as 4 strokes, and the New

<P>

<LI> The JUU or ASHIATO radical is at the bottom of ¶Ù and ã¼. It is
traditionally counted as 5 strokes, although sometimes it looks like 4.
I'm using 5 throughout.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>A related shape is ¥à, as in ±», ¸É, ¸Ì, etc. This is sometimes counted 
as two strokes (both Nelsons) and sometimes as three strokes (Halpern, S&amp;H).
Classically it is regarded as two strokes. I am using 6 strokes for ±».
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> The pattern to the left of ÚÉ, which appears in several kanji, e.g.
Ê¾ and ÊÍ, has 8 strokes. (There are 3 strokes at the top as in ¾°.)
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> The "east" pattern (Åì) has 8 strokes. There is an older form in which
there are two strokes in the box (ÛË). It is counted as 8
strokes here in the Åì form  (e.g. ´Ò) and 9 in the ÛË form, as in ëÝ.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI> The pattern at the bottom of ð´ is counted as 4 strokes in modern
dictionaries, although traditionally it was 5.

</LI>
<LI> The pattern ´¬, which appears in several kanji, is counted as 9 strokes.
Several dictionaries count it as either 8 or 9.

Note  The JIS X 0208-1990 standard does not formally specify the precise
glyphs used for kanji, however the glyphs it uses in the published
version have become de facto standards for many font compilations. In
the published standard, for several kanji, e.g. Ã©/íé, Îé/ã«, µ²/Ò¬, the
JIS level one kanji use the simpler form, and the Level 2 kanji use the
older more complex form. Just to make matters worse, many fonts for
JIS X 0208 kanji are based on the bit-maps specified in JIS X 9051-1984
standard, which defines the 16x16 patterns for JIS X 0208-1983 characters.
According to Ken Lunde: "This standard was not very good, and JSA is no
longer supporting it."
Anyway, JIS X 9051-1984 had the simpler form for all these bushu in both
Levels 1 and 2, as well as having simplifications of kanji like ßÉ. Thus,
as the font foundries have freedom to choose whichever glyphs they like,
what you see on your screen may well not agree with these rules. All
the rules in this appendix relate to the glyphs as published in the
JIS X 0208-1990 standard, and as appearing in font compilations based
on them.

<b><a name="IREF14">APPENDIX F.CONDITIONS FOR USING SKIP DATA by Jack Halpern (jack@kanji.org)</a></b>
</P>
<P>
Ever since my New Japanese-English Character Dictionary (NJECD) came
out (Kenkyusha 1990, NTC 1993), I have been getting inquiries asking for
permission to use SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) data in
software products and electronic dictionaries. Below I explain the
policy of the Kanji Dictionary Publishing Society (KDPS) on how to use
copyright issues when distributing SKIP data or using it in software
product or electronic dictionary.
</P>
<P>
WHAT IS SKIP?
</P>
<P>
Briefly, SKIP is an indexing system that enables the user to locate
kanji quickly and accurately. The system is extremely convenient because
it can be learned in a very short time, is easy to use, and requires very
little prior knowledge of kanji.
</P>
<P>
The central idea of SKIP is the classification of characters into four
major categories on the basis of easy-to-identify geometrical
&lt;patterns&gt;:
</P>
<PRE>
1. Left-right
2. Up-down
3. Enclosure
4. Solid
</PRE>
Characters belonging to the first three categories are arranged in
ascending order of hyphenated numerals that represent the number of
strokes in the &lt;shaded part,&gt; and the number of strokes in the &lt;blank
part.&gt; See http://www.kanji.org and NJECD front matter for details.
<P>
To distribute SKIP data within a group or use it in a commercial
or non-commercial product, please confirm that you agree to the following
conditions:

<LI>ROYALTIES
<P>
SKIP is a product of seven years of computer-assisted research and
experimentation on how kanji elements are intuitively perceived in
terms of their parts. Development work was financed by private funds
and research grants. To enable us to continue to develop useful data
and products, we ask for you cooperation by paying KDPS (the Kanji
Dictionary Publishing Society) a royalty 0.5% (negotiable) if you are
using the data for a commercial product. Depending on the circumstances,
it is also possible to use SKIP data free of charge or at a lower
royalty.

<P>
AN OVERVIEW OF THE DE ROO SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
[This document contains the text found in the second edition of "2001 Kanji"
edited by Joseph R. De Roo and published by Bonjinsha.]
</P>
<P>
The system used in "2001 Kanji" is intended for the beginner who encounters
a kanji and wants to look it up, knowing neither its radical, pronunciation,
nor its exact number of strokes. The method consists of looking at the top
of the kanji, and then at its bottom, disregarding its other parts.
</P>
<P>
"2001 Kanji" provides drawings for all graphic elements. This information
cannot be reproduced here. However, an attempt was made to describe each
element as much as possible given the constraints of a computer text file,
and examples of characters possessing the element are always given.
</P>
<PRE>
Two-step visual method for locating a kanji:
<P>
1. Observe its EXTREME TOP or LEFT TOP.
</P>
<P>
There are only four possibilities: DOT (Ð¦), VERTICAL LINE (¡Ã), DIAGONAL
LINE (¥Î), HORIZONTAL LINE (°ì). Each of these four strokes can occur either
in isolation or in connection with one or more strokes. Each of the four
groups of graphic elements correspond to the four basic strokes in their
immediate environment. Each element has a number wich will become the first
half of the kanji number.

The number of the kanji you are looking for consists of the top number
coming first and the bottom number coming second, the two numbers being
placed side by side. E.g., ´Á 363 (3 63), »ú 747 (7 47).
</P>
<P>
There are two rules always to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
a. Ignore the complete enclosure Óø and the "road" radical (as in Æ»). Look
at the top and bottom (in some cases only the bottom) of what is inside the
complete enclosure, and of what is to the upper right of "road". E.g.,
¼ü 1262, ¸Ä 2177, Æ» 979, Ë¥ 2755.
</P>
<P>
b. When a part is enclosed by the "gate" radical, take the bottom or right
bottom of that part. E.g., Æ® 3848, Íó 1864.
