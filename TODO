- hmm
- nothing else! :))

2.0 wishlist by Neil:

- move all QRegExp generation into namespace Dict, so Kiten et. al. just tell
Dict what kind of search they want, and Dict tells them the regexp they need
to pass Dict::Index.

- get all SearchResults and Entries into one hierarchy.

- split the two tabs of the learn mode into separate dialogs, or even make
learn a separate app.

- rewrite the index generator

- factor out the gjiten heuristic of figuring out kanji/kana/roomaji

- add load and save as to Learn mode
