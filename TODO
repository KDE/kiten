Category: (F)eature, (B)ug, (R)elease Requirement, (C)ode Organizaion, (?)Investigate as possible
        (+/- indicate relative importance IMNSHO)
	(RECURRENT) = After a release, move this to the next planned release

---------------------------TODO Details---------------------------
MVC: Primary advantages of moving to a model-view system are that we would be able to offer things like
	"right click on the entry, and see a list of other fields that could be displayed". Mouse-over kanji
	writing and such would be easy
	Disadvantages: the current CSS code is fairly easy to work with and understand

Preferences Framework:
	At the moment, the lib and app preference files need to be exactly in sync, or a crash will occur.
	We probably need to make our own layer on top of the general preferences code.
	Connections:
		Select Dictionary File:
			Currently handled entirely between app and .kcfg (lib is just a server here)
		Select Display Fields:
			List of widgets is returned from DictionaryManager, plugged into a KTabWidget
			by the app. Requires app to include space in .kcfg if supporting a dict type.
			Display Field includes things like "--NewLine--"
		Sort Order:
			DictionaryManager is asked for a complete <long name> -> <short abbreviation>
			QMap. Uses the keys from this.

Multi-search;
	This capability would allow you to select, for example, all words that contain any of a list of kanji.
	Alternatively, it would allow you select all words that contain at least one of the listed kanji, and
	no kanji that are not on the list. The interface for this might be tricky.

Sequential Lists
	Be able to generate sequential learning lists, given a list of known kanji
	The Layered method is either very time intensive, or very memory intensive
		pick one and try implementing. Provided we limit the lists to containing
		only the resultant kanji, even the memory intensive version will only be a
		few (~20) megs for fairly large lists. Even on modern hardware, a perl implementation
		with ~40 kanji on each list takes about 10-15 seconds to run.
	Split into a separate app.  This is the optimal time for a complete rewrite
		"inspired by learn mode".

Other Formats:
	(Potential) other formats to look into:
		(fre)epwing: http://www.sra.co.jp/people/m-kasahr/freepwing/
			using libeb?  Using it would allow "accessing EB, EBG, EBXA and EPWING CD-ROM dictionaries"
		jdictionary: http://jdictionary.info/
		stardict: http://stardict.sourceforge.net
		DICT: http://www.dict.org/
			English -> English mainly, but networked ... would be cool to see.
			Check out kdict for a client in action.
		JMDict: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/j_jmdict.html


---------------------------Design Notes---------------------------
Search String Design:
	Add some complex search capabilities (space seperated or symbol seperated)
		Search String BNF: [<item>]*
			<item> ::= <non-japanese meaning - not allowed to contain ':'>
			<item> ::= <kana word - must be exclusively kana>
			<item> ::= <word containing kanji - may contain kana>
			<item> ::= <key>:<extended value>
			<key> ::= either a single character or code for one of the dictionaries
			<extended value> ::= a value that the key has to match
		The Search <item> list is "and"ed together logically, to determine results
			This can be modified with the match-type setting, which is evaluated
			seperately for each field

Code Audit Checklist:
	Static Variables (avoid them)... use KStaticDeleter with pointers if needed
	Static Methods (use them if possible)
	Forward Declarations (eliminate header includes from header files)
	Iterators (Cache an Iterator.end() object instead of using end() in the loop)
	Iterators (Use const interators whenever possible)
	Iterators (foreach)
	Review the Initialization chain for using Delayed Init
	Double check the QCString usage for termination (in the indexer code)
	Use QString.isNull() and isEmpty()... not comparison to QString(""), "" or QString::null
	Use deleteLater() as a shortcut instead of manually implementing QTimer::oneShot() code
	Check ALL files for i18n strings that are not inside of i18n() or tr() methods
	Look through and get rid of redundant headers (particularly in the lib files)
