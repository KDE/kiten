<em>The following is summary information about <b>KANJIDIC</b> and

<p><b>Introduction</b>

<p> The <b>KANJIDIC</b> file contains comprehensive information 
about Japanese kanji. It is  a  text file 
with one line for each  of the 6,355 kanji specified in the 
JIS X 0208-1990  set, plus a header line.  (For information  
about this set,  see Appendix A of the documentation file.) <p>

The <b>KANJD212</b> file is also a text file containing comprehensive 
information about the
5,801 kanji in the JIS X 0212-1990 supplementary character set.
<p>
The files have been compiled and maintained by
<A HREF="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/index.html">Jim Breen</A>,
and were cited as references used in the compilation of the new
edition of the Nelson character dictionary.<p>
<P>
<B>KANJIDIC2</B>
<p>
The KANJIDIC2 file, which is an XML-format version of
the data in KANJIDIC and KANJD212 is now available. The KANJIDIC2 page
is <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2">here</a>.
<p>
<B>Is it Public Domain?</B>

<P>
KANJIDIC, KANJD212 and KANJIDIC2 can be freely used provided satisfactory 
acknowledgement is made
in any software product, server, etc. that uses them. There are a few other 
conditions relating to distributing copies of the files with or without
modification.  Copyright is vested in the

 <a HREF="http://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html">licence statement </a>
at the Group's site.
</P>
The files are available from the Monash University ftp site 
<A HREF="http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjidic.gz">here</a> and
<A HREF="http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/kanjd212.gz">here</a>.
<p>
The information about each kanji consists of: 
<UL> 
<LI> coding information about the kanji: including its identification 
in various code-sets (JIS, Unicode), and identifying codes derived 
from its structure (radical, stroke-count, Four-Corner, SKIP); 

<LI> lexicographic information about the kanji: pronunciations and 
meanings; 

<LI> indexing information providing identification of the kanji in 
several major dictionaries and reference books. 
</UL>

<b>KANJIDIC</b>  is used now to build the kinfo.dat file which is 
used by JDIC, JREADER, WinJDic  and JWPce.  kinfo.dat  contains  the  
identical information,  but  in  a compressed form and in a 
structure suitable for fast indexed access. <b>KANJIDIC</b>  is  
also  used in its native format by the xjdic and MacJDic dictionary 
programs,  the WWWJDIC server, and a growing number of other programs such as KDRILL and 
KDIC. <p>

The files contains a mixture of ASCII characters and kana/kanji 
encoded using the EUC (Extended Unix Code) coding. The following is 
an example (folded) of one of the entry lines in <b>KANJIDIC</b>; 
the kanji with the meaning "east". <p>

Apart from the first two fields, the information fields 
in each entry have an identifying capital letter. The fields in 
the sample entry are:

<UL> 

<LI> the kanji itself; 

<LI> the JIS code of the kanji in hexadecimal; 

<LI> [U] the Unicode/ISO 10646 code of the kanji in hexadecimal; 

<LI> [N] the index in Nelson (Modern Reader's Japanese-English 
Character Dictionary) 

<LI> [B] the classification radical number of the kanji (as in 
Nelson); 

<LI> [C] the "classical" radical number (where this differs from 
the one used in Nelson); 

<LI> [S] the total stroke-count of the kanji; 

<LI> [G] the "grade" of the kanji, In this case, G2 means it is 
a Jouyou (general use) kanji taught in the second year of elementary 
schooling in Japan; 

<LI> [H] the index in Halpern (New Japanese-English Character 
Dictionary); 

<LI> [F] the rank-order frequency of occurrence of the kanji in 
Japanese; 

<LI> [P] the "SKIP" coding of the kanji, as used in Halpern; 

<LI> [K] the index in the  Gakken  Kanji  Dictionary  (A  New 
Dictionary  of Kanji Usage); 

<LI> [L] the index in Heisig (Remembering The  Kanji); 

<LI> [I] the index in  the  Spahn  &  Hadamitsky  dictionary.  

<LI> [Q] the Four-Corner code; 

<LI> [MN,MP] the index and page number in the 13-volume Morohashi 
"DaiKanWaJiten"; 

<LI> [E] the index in Henshall (A Guide To Remembering Japanese 
Characters); 

<LI> [Y] the PinYin (Chinese) pronunciation(s) of the kanji; 

<LI> the Japanese pronunciations or "readings" of the kanji. These 
are in the katakana script for "ON" (i.e of Chinese origin) 
readings, and hiragana for "KUN" (Japanese origin) readings. Thus <p>
<img src="tou.gif"> <p>
is the ON reading, and <p>
<img src="higashi.gif"> <p>
is the KUN reading. These are optionally followed by a "T" plus one or more 
"nanori", which are the special readings only used with proper names. 

<LI> Finally, the meanings associated with the kanji, each 
encapsulated with {...}.
